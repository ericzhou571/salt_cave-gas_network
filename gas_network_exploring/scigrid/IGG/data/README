Hence the following applies to this data set and the documentation:


## Project details 

    Project title: 	Open Source Reference Model of European Gas Transport Networks for Scientific Studies on Sector Coupling (Offenes Referenzmodell europäischer Gastransportnetze für wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zur Sektorkopplung)

    Acronym: 		SciGRID_gas (Scientific GRID gas)

    Funding period: Januar 2018 - December 20 20

    Funding agency: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie), Germany

    Funding Code: 	03ET4063

    Project partner(s): DLR Institute for Networked Energy Systems (individual project)


## System requirements

To visualize the abstracted gas transmission network resulting from the SciGRID_gas code, you can use internal SciGRID_gas functionlity, or export the data as GeoJson, and use ???


## Installation 

No installation required to use the data.


## Documentation

A detailed documentation of the SciGRID_gas data is available in the userguide (in folder doc). The userguide includes detailed information about the SciGRID_gas code structure, SciGRID_gas data structure, and how to run the SciGRID_gas model. Moreover, the userguide includes information about the simplifications and assumptions of the SciGRID_gas model as well as information about how the different data sources can be merged and missing data be estimated.
