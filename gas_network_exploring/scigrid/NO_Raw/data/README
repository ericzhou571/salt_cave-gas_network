## Data content

The data supplied is a data set of part of a European transmission data set, generated through the SciGRID_gas project.  Data is supplied as CSV files, where the data for each gas component (such as storages, or LNG terminals) is being written into an individual CSV file.  
The dataset contains elements (e.g. LNG terminal in Rotterdam) of the components.  In addition each element contains attribute values, such as gas storage capacity and others.  This information can be used for modelling the gas flow in Europe.


## Data description

The data supplied has been generated by converting the norwegan national grid data set into SciGRID_gas data set format:
- Norway, containing information for the following components:
	- Gas pipelines
	- Nodes
This dat set contains only raw data.  No missing attribute values were generated.  


## License

SciGRID_gas is free and open data, based on freely availabel data representing the gas transmission network data set for Europe.
The data originated from the Norwegan gas company "Gassco", and can be found in form of a shape file under
https://factpages.npd.no/downloads/shape/pipLine.zip.  Copyright regulation of the original data can be found under https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/.

However, if you use this data or any data set which incorporates this data, you are also obliged to cite the original authors of the NO data as follows:

## Project details 

    Project title: 	Open Source Reference Model of European Gas Transport Networks for Scientific Studies on Sector Coupling (Offenes Referenzmodell europäischer Gastransportnetze für wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zur Sektorkopplung)

    Acronym: 		SciGRID_gas (Scientific GRID gas)

    Funding period: Januar 2018 - December 20 20

    Funding agency: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie), Germany

    Funding Code: 	03ET4063

    Project partner(s): DLR Institute for Networked Energy Systems (individual project)


## System requirements

To visualize the abstracted gas transmission network resulting from the SciGRID_gas code, you can use internal SciGRID_gas functionlity, or export the data as GeoJson, and use ???


## Installation 

No installation required to use the data.


## Documentation

A detailed documentation of the SciGRID_gas data is available in the userguide (in folder doc). The userguide includes detailed information about the SciGRID_gas code structure, SciGRID_gas data structure, and how to run the SciGRID_gas model. Moreover, the userguide includes information about the simplifications and assumptions of the SciGRID_gas model as well as information about how the different data sources can be merged and missing data be estimated.
