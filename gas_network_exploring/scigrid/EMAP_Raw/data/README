## Data content

The data supplied is a data set of part of a European transmission data set, generated through the SciGRID_gas project.  Data is supplied as CSV files, where the data for each gas component (such as storages, or LNG terminals) is being written into an individual CSV file.  
The dataset contains elements (e.g. Storages by Empelde) of the components.  In addition each element contains a small number of attribute values.  This information can be used for modelling the gas flow in Europe.


## Data description

The data supplied has been generated by converting the EntsoG map into SciGRID_gas data set format:
- EntsoG-Map, containing information for the following components:
	- Gas pipelines
	- Nodes
	- Production sites
	- Storage sites
This dat set contains only raw data.  No missing attribute values were generated.  
The original approach of converting the EntsoG-Map PDF file into a shape file format was originally proposed by Incio Yueksel-Erguen and Janina Zittel (Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB)).

## Project details 

    Project title: 	Open Source Reference Model of European Gas Transport Networks for Scientific Studies on Sector Coupling (Offenes Referenzmodell europäischer Gastransportnetze für wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zur Sektorkopplung)

    Acronym: 		SciGRID_gas (Scientific GRID gas)

    Funding period: Januar 2018 - December 2020

    Funding agency: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie), Germany

    Funding Code: 	03ET4063

    Project partner(s): DLR Institute for Networked Energy Systems (individual project)


## System requirements

To visualize the abstracted gas transmission network resulting from the SciGRID_gas code, you can use internal SciGRID_gas functionlity, or use the exported data e.g. GeoJson.


## Installation 

No installation required to use the data.


## Documentation

A detailed documentation of the SciGRID_gas data is available in the userguide (in folder doc). The userguide includes detailed information about the SciGRID_gas code structure, SciGRID_gas data structure, and how to run the SciGRID_gas model. Moreover, the userguide includes information about the simplifications and assumptions of the SciGRID_gas model as well as information about how the different data sources can be merged and missing data be estimated.
