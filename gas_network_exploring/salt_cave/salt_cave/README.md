# HSL is not better than RGB
    - HSL can better deal with noise and background, but cluster a lot of pixels into wrong capacity groups
    - RGB can also deal with noise and background, but slightly a little bit poorer than HSL. However it can clustering pixel correctly.
    - A lot of noise or background in RGB space with threshold=50, looks like have color like pink. I'm wondering if they are actually not noise.
**Finally use RGB space.**
